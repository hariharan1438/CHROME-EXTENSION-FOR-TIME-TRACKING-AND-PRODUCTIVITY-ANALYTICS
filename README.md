##Chrome Time Tracker is a productivity-focused Chrome extension designed to help users efficiently track their time usage within the browser. This extension monitors active browser tabs, records time spent on each, and provides visual feedback to help users analyze and manage their browsing habits. Built using JavaScript, HTML, and JSON for the manifest configuration, it includes a clean popup interface, background scripts, and server-side integration using Node.js to store and analyze data. With customizable icons and a structured codebase, this project serves as a great starting point for developers interested in building time management tools or learning Chrome extension development.
